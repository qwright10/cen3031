# About

SnapCards is a web-based study platform that allows you to create, share, and study quizzes you make from study materials. It automatically scores quiz attempts and provides feedback about correct/incorrect answers and how you're is performing over time. SnapCards can be integrated into a busy college studentâ€™s study routine to review lecture material for a quiz, refresh his or her memory of a prerequisite course, or prepare for a cumulative final exam covering months of material.

# Getting Started

- Take a quiz and review personalized feedback
